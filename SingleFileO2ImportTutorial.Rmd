# Introduction
We use an optode to measure [O2] Âµmol l-1 in suspensions of phytoplankton.
Changes in [O2] reflect (hopefully) oxygen evolution or oxygen consumption by the cell suspension.

# Materials and Methods

This .Rmd Rworkbook imports data in simple .txt .tsv form exported from FireSting optodes based upon project specific values for variables set by the user.

It tidies and organizes the data.

```{r load libraries} 
# libraries; Note check actual dependencies
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

## To-Do list:

variable name is in two rows, need to find a way to make variable name in two rows into one row.
Need to match the tube number from file name with Ch1O2 etc... 
Need to match each run with date from catalog
create preliminary graphs

## Priority List
-single data file import for O2
-multi-file batch data import (may not be fully feasible given we need match multiple files together in some cases)
-O2 preliminary plots
-merge O2 plots as over-lays of growth plots (time axis may be tricky but I think I know how)

## First Try Import Dialog Under 'Environment' to import a single file into a dataframe.

File delimiter is '.tsv' b/c the instrument software is from Europe.
